# PAPIF
Simple(-minded) example to use PAPI from Fortran.

We spent far too long putting this together, lacking a better description of the API than can be found in [PAPI's](http://icl.cs.utk.edu/papi) [doxygen](http://icl.cs.utk.edu/papi/docs/d1/d82/group__PAPIF.html). This is very basic, but should help you as a starting point.
